/**
 * Renders a tremulant: every audio period it moves a cursor along the loop of
 * its wave form and publishes the amplitude multiplier for the windchests.
 *
 * The depth g (0 .. 1) of the modulation ramps up over the start time when the
 * tremulant is engaged and down over the stop time when it is disengaged, from
 * any position of the loop. The cursor speeds up and slows down together with
 * g. From its tremulant the task reads only IsEngaged() (on the audio thread,
 * without synchronization) and, on the control thread, the parameters through
 * BuildWaveForm().
 *
 * It also publishes the pitch rates of the round (GetPitchRateChunk()) for the
 * vibrato processors of the windchests; both are read from one cursor, so the
 * amplitude and the pitch modulation stay in phase.
